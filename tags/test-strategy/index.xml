      <description>Note, this post was originally published on INNOQ blog together with Torsten Mandry and Theo Pack.
In our previous posts, we focused on why and how we write tests. In most of our projects, there will be many of those tests. In the last post about tests granularity, we additionally stated that there usually will be different kinds of tests, on different levels of granularity. That leads to our next topic: which kinds of tests do we need and what is the ideal mix of them?</description>
