      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s probably one of quite a few videos about that topic, but probably the only one publicly available that I know of. The topic is: value, as in how &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; perceives what we, engineers are doing. It&amp;rsquo;s probably the one thing that turns you from a mere code writer to a professional software engineer. At least this is how I feel now that I understand the idea. My recommendation to all developers, if you want to advance your career, learn about value, everything else are implementation details.</description>

      <description>This is unfortunately a paid material but I believe it was worth buying. Before I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this whole series I theoretically knew what TDD is and how to do it, but I always struggled with it. Watching this series has shown me how to apply all this theoretical knowledge, put most pieces in place.
