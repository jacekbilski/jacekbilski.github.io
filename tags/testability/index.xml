      <description>Foreword This article was originally posted on INNOQ blog.
After it was published it caused a bit of a discussion on Twitter (even the creator of Spring Framework, Rod Johnson, replied) but also internally in the company (sorry, not public). The reason is, I believe, I&amp;rsquo;ve failed to clearly state my intention right from the start. My goal when writing this post always was to say: whenever you can write a test for your application without using Spring, you should do it exatly this way.</description>
