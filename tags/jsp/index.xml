      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve dug some more, debugged some more and know a little more. The whole problem with Apache MyFaces and ContentType comes from the awful idea that there is more than one moment, when, for a single request, resulting ContentType is evaluated.
MyFaces looks at Accept HTTP header, which, in my case, states text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8. MyFaces goes through that list and picks first entry which it understands, in my case that&amp;rsquo;s text/html. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter, that next entry application/xhtml+xml is what I would really want, &amp;ldquo;text/html&amp;rdquo; was first.</description>
