      <description>This post was originally posted on INNOQ blog.
Note: In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m using the terms &amp;ldquo;behaviour&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;structure&amp;rdquo; to describe more &amp;ldquo;dynamic&amp;rdquo; and more &amp;ldquo;static&amp;rdquo; properties of a particular system or piece of software. That is, I&amp;rsquo;m using the term &amp;ldquo;structure&amp;rdquo; for properties like &amp;ldquo;Java is a statically-typed language&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;We follow Java Beans convention in this project&amp;rdquo;. On the other hand, &amp;ldquo;behaviour&amp;rdquo; to me are things like &amp;ldquo;The application correctly calculates SHA-512 checksum&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;The calculations are done within 10 seconds&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>My previous posts were rather theoretical, a lot of philosophy, very little code. This time I&amp;rsquo;ll do almost the opposite, I&amp;rsquo;ll be actually writing a little system before your eyes, so there will be a lot of code. I will be referring to some concepts I was writing about previously, but this time I&amp;rsquo;ll not be discussing them, just applying.
Motivation There are many reasons I want to do this:</description>

      <title>Microservices - a solution or a problem?</title>

      <description>Microservices seem to be everywhere, everybody is talking about them, writing and consuming them. For a good reason, they can solve a lot of problems like scaling, high availability, independent developability, etc. But are they really THE solution to our problems? Do we always remember their costs?
Integration One of the good things about microservices is, that they&amp;rsquo;re simple. Each one should be easy to understand even by a new person joining a team.</description>
