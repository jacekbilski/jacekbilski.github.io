      <description>While working with a customer, I recently saw a test, that looked like this: throw a big XML (&amp;gt;10kB) at a function, get another XML of similar size back and compare it with a pre-recorded one. The test is green if they&amp;rsquo;re equal. I guess, at the very minimum, it serves a purpose of detecting issues. The problem is that it cannot do much more.
What such a test is not providing are hints as to what the problem is when it fails.</description>
