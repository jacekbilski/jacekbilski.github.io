      <description>Software development seems to me like the only discipline where practitioners can get away with producing crap. If you&amp;rsquo;re a doctor and you screw up surgery or treatment, in the worst case you will kill your patient, in the best you will not make his/her situation worse. If you&amp;rsquo;re a bridge builder and you&amp;rsquo;ll make a mistake during construction, in the worst case the bridge will collapse killing people, in the best case, the bridge will be usable only after adding some additional support to it.</description>
