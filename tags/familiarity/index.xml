      <description>The first part of this post was not really meant to be a first part of, possibly, a longer series. Yet, I seem to have found another case where things that we know and ways how we work might be preventing us from finding other solutions, possibly better.

      <description>Familiarity seems like a good thing, you know the thing, how to deal with it, what to expect and where problems might be hiding. But more and more I see its dark side.
Some time ago I was working on a legacy system. It was very complex and fragile, most developers didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have anything to do with it. We knew the time would come when we would need to touch the core of this monster, so we wrote some tests and started slowly cleaning it up.</description>
