      <description>I previously wrote about simplicity and how it helps to understand software code. In that post, I already mentioned the use of concepts like set theory. Iâ€™d like to expand on this and show how to boost readability of code.
Despite what people might think, our main purpose as developers is not writing software, but solving problems. A code is just a means, not the goal. Nobody demands software just for the sake of it from a developer.</description>

      <description>Some time ago, my colleague Joy Clark wrote about simplicity. I&amp;rsquo;ve also approached this topic once before. I&amp;rsquo;d like to follow up on both articles and show how simplicity can boost our understanding of software. I will also propose that we look at other disciplines to see if and how simplicity affects them. Maybe we can benefit from their experience.
What&amp;rsquo;s all the fuss about? Why do we even talk about simplicity?</description>
