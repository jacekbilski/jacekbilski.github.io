      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve dug some more, debugged some more and know a little more. The whole problem with Apache MyFaces and ContentType comes from the awful idea that there is more than one moment, when, for a single request, resulting ContentType is evaluated.
MyFaces looks at Accept HTTP header, which, in my case, states text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8. MyFaces goes through that list and picks first entry which it understands, in my case that&amp;rsquo;s text/html. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter, that next entry application/xhtml+xml is what I would really want, &amp;ldquo;text/html&amp;rdquo; was first.</description>

      <description>For the last couple of days, I was struggling with Java ServerFaces. The exact problem was, that commandButtons were working as expected, but commandLinks were not. We are using Apache MyFaces with Tomahawk and Sandbox components. We were going to use commandLinks for navigation and other uses like selecting nodes in Tomahawks&amp;rsquo; tree2 component, but we were forced to render commandButtons instead, which looked quite awkward in some places.
Symptoms we got, were that three browsers: Firefox, Opera and Konqueror, were complaining about &amp;ldquo;oamSubmitForm is not defined&amp;rdquo; after clicking a commandLink.</description>
