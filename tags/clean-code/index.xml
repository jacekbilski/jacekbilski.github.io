      <description>My previous posts were rather theoretical, a lot of philosophy, very little code. This time I&amp;rsquo;ll do almost the opposite, I&amp;rsquo;ll be actually writing a little system before your eyes, so there will be a lot of code. I will be referring to some concepts I was writing about previously, but this time I&amp;rsquo;ll not be discussing them, just applying.
Motivation There are many reasons I want to do this:</description>

      <description>Below are my guiding principles, that are the basis of what, how and why am I doing with regards to software development.
Long term development speed First and foremost I understand my main responsibility as delivering value as fast as possible in the long term. By delivering value I mean adding, changing or removing features, that &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; requested, but also things like:
 improving processes around me, both technical, like application deployment, and business, like simplifying stock management, proposing and introducing new techniques and technologies whenever I feel that they will improve things, sharing knowledge within and outside of the team (blog, mentoring, pair/crowd programming, etc.</description>

      <description>Software development seems to me like the only discipline where practitioners can get away with producing crap. If you&amp;rsquo;re a doctor and you screw up surgery or treatment, in the worst case you will kill your patient, in the best you will not make his/her situation worse. If you&amp;rsquo;re a bridge builder and you&amp;rsquo;ll make a mistake during construction, in the worst case the bridge will collapse killing people, in the best case, the bridge will be usable only after adding some additional support to it.</description>
