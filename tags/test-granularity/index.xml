In two previous posts (see below) we discussed the benefits of automated tests and the properties of a good test. So far we were trying to avoid differentiating the tests in any way. This time we want to address one way how tests can be classified: tests granularity.

In our last post, we focused on why we should write tests and what value they provide. This time we will go far more technical and take a look at a single test. We will show what makes a test a good one and describe desired and unwanted properties. Interestingly enough, all those properties hold, no matter how isolated or integrated the test is.</description>
