      <description>Some time ago, my colleague Joy Clark wrote about simplicity . I&amp;rsquo;ve also approached this topic once before. I&amp;rsquo;d like to follow up on both articles and show how simplicity can boost our understanding of software. I will also propose that we look at other disciplines to see if and how simplicity affects them. Maybe we can benefit from their experience.
What&amp;rsquo;s all the fuss about? Why do we even talk about simplicity?</description>
