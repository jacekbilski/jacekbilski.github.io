    <p>I&rsquo;ve dug some more, debugged some more and know a little more. The whole problem with Apache MyFaces and ContentType comes from the awful idea that there is more than one moment, when, for a single request, resulting ContentType is evaluated.</p>
<p>MyFaces looks at Accept HTTP header, which, in my case, states <code>text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8</code>. MyFaces goes through that list and picks first entry which it understands, in my case that&rsquo;s <code>text/html</code>. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter, that next entry <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> is what I would really want, &ldquo;text/html&rdquo; was first.</p>
<p>But JSP mechanism, when it sees something like <code>&lt;jsp:directive.page contentType=&quot;application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8&quot;/&gt;</code> it does as it is instructed to do and sets ContentType to <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember now which one comes first, MyFaces or JSP, but something is definitely wrong here. I would like to assume, that when one of those chooses ContentType, the other respects that or if the other one changes it, the first one won&rsquo;t be stubborn and doesn&rsquo;t force its choice. The second solution could be hard to implement, so the first one is the way to go. I would expect that MyFaces before it selects ContentType, tries to get that information from a response that was given to them. And that I will probably file as a bug.</p>
